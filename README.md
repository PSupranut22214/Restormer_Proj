# Restormer Project

This project presents a **comparative study of video denoising techniques**, ranging from classical image processing methods to a modern deep learning–based approach. 
The objective is to evaluate how traditional filters perform compared to a pretrained transformer-based model, **Restormer**, when applied to noisy video data.

Rather than proposing a new model, this project focuses on **experimental design, controlled evaluation, and qualitative analysis** using real video input.
